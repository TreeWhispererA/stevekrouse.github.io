# Mentoring

I've been incredibly lucky to have wonderful mentors in my life, starting with my parents, Rodger and Hillary, my Uncle Steve Cohen, Danny Govberg, Harrison Lieberfarb, Brett Berson, Lloyd Tabb, Tim Levin, Peter Kuperman, and Scott Mueller.

[As I realized many years ago](./giver.html), there's a limit to how much I can pay back their kindness. The only true way to show my respect is by paying it forward by mentoring others.

## Mentor Mindset

The do-er mindset is quite different than the mentor mindset. As a do-er, one tries to, well, do things. Do-ers do things as efficiently as possible -- it's all about speed and doing things right the first time. However, this mindset will cause a lot of fustration, both for the mentor and mentee, because what a mentee needs is patience, empathy and validation. The mentee also needs to feel your respect and acceptance.

If you treat an individual as he is, he will stay as he is, but if you treat him as if he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be. - Johan Wolfgang von Goethe<sup>[1](#1)</sup>

### Motivational Interviewing Prayer<sup>[2](#2)</sup>

Guide me to be a patient compassion,
to listen with a heart as open as the sky.
Grant me vision to see through her eyes
and eager ears to hear her story.
Create a safe and open mesa on which we may walk together.
Make me a clear pool in which she may reflect.
Guide me to find in her your beauty and wisdom,
knowing your desire for her to be in harmony:
healthy loving and strong.
Let me honor and respect her choosing of her own path,
and bless her to walk it freely.
May I know once again that although she and I are different,
yet there is a peaceful place where we are one.

### Accentuate the positive 

As a mentor, it's easy to focus on the negative. All the ways you can see room for improvement. It's harder, but so much more important to focus on the positive, all the ways in which your mentee is already wonderful. Focus your attention there. Acknowledge what you see. Leverage the positives to improve the negatives.

### Praise<sup>[3](#3)</sup>

Praise is complicated. In short, here are [the 4 steps](https://medium.com/@stevekrouse/the-4-steps-to-giving-magical-praise-7b2732ae5630):

1. Describe in detail
2. Share how it makes you feel
3. Don't evaluate
4. Watch them praise themselves

### Empathy & Validation<sup>[3](#3)</sup>

When your mentee (or anyone) becomes fustrated and comes to your with their emotions, your first instinct may be to disagree with what they're saying. However while not intentional, this has the effect of invalidating their emotions. It will make them feel unheard. It will prevent them from working through their emotions, proccessing them, and moving on.

Instead, accept and validate the emotions and fustration -- without neccesarily agreeing with what they're saying.
