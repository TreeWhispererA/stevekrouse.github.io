# Debugging Myself

After reading Peak by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool, I now firmly believe that anyone can improve to *any skill level* (barring certain phsyical limitations for certain sports) through *deliberate practice*. [Not only is this insight a scientific breakthrough, but I belive it could become an ideological shift](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2288939/30006826-aa565c4a-90cf-11e7-877d-408f4913bbbf.png) that transforms our culture for the better.

Since reading Peak, I now find myself newly empowered to improve in various parts of my life that I never even considered before: I could learn to sing, dance, play piano, and the list goes on and on. I quickly found myself overwhelmed by all of the ways I could improve, and *almost* gave up. Instead, I decided to write down all of the ways I'm trying to improve here on my website so I can be less overwhelmed and more systematic about improving myself.

As a computer scientist, I found the way that Ericsson and Pool explained deliberate practice reminded me of the systematic way that programmers fix the errors in their code: debugging.

### Debugging Myself (this page)

## Soon

### Schedule optimization

I've been doing a decent job thinking about this on my futureofcoding.org/journal but I think I can be even more specific on how I want to spend my hours. I want to be much more precise about where I spend my time than I have been. Less ballparking it and more specific numbers. Even to the minute if I can.

### Be able to non-awkwardly and non-threateningly approach strangers

### Optimizing the food I eat

Getting more knowledge about how different foods affect my mood and energy, like Scott Adams discusses in How to Fail.

### Non-violent communication


## Eventually

### Singing well enough to not be embarressed in public

### Dancing well enough to not be embarressed in public

### Piano well enough to figure out how to play a song I like on my own

### Tweet regularly for a period of time

### Blog regularly for a period of time

I think a good way to go about this is to set aside a period of time each week for blogging (which can include releasing them) in which I can write on any number of pieces. Basically, don't set a target for the number of released pieces but just the amount of time on the calendar each week. Given that I already write a ton already in various journals, this can mostly be aggregating, clarifying and publishing time.
