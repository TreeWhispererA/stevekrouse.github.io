<h1>A Cursory Education On Education</h1>
<div id="date">JUNE 13, 2015</div>

<p>Towards the end of last year, I decided that I wanted to make a difference in education.</p>

<p>The problem was that I didn't know much more about education than my personal experiences as a student.</p>

<p>I knew that problems abounded, but I wanted to find the best place to make an impact, and the how to leverage that impact using the latest findings in education research.</p>

<p>To that end, I had a lot of questions. Luckily for me, there are people that took the time to painstakingly research, compile, analyze and write down the answers to these questions into digestible books and blogs. I present those questions and the writings that answer them below.</p>
