# Dreams

There are a number of problems in the world that I'm passionate about solving, a number of projects that I've dreamt up that I want to see in exsistance. Some of them I would love to create or help create myself. However there's only so much time in the day, so others I'd be happy simply to have them exist, and would be thrilled to inspire someone else to make them happen. 


### Future of Coding

I want to enable people to learn to think computationally, which I'm working on at [The Coding Space](http://thecodingspace.com) and with [WoofJS](http://woofjs.com), and leverage (and also deepen) their computational thinking abilities to bend technology to their will, use comptuers as their canvas, as a place to express themselves and their ideas. To this end, I spend the majority of my working time devoted to my [Future of Coding](http://futureofcoding.org) project. This project has two aims. The main aim of this project is to create a product or tool that truly democratizes the full power of comptuers to all people (which will also help enable them to learn to think computationally as well). The second aim of this project is to facilitate a dialogue for researchers in this space which will help us all achieve the first aim.

### LogicHub

LogicHub is a tool and platform that will try to help humanity as a whole become more logical, which in turn will accelerate the speed at which we approach truth. The idea is to create a new type of medium where people can have structured debates around propositions, referencing facts, arguments, and other propositions. I envision a centralized place for the wisdom of humanity where the most logical ideas and arguments bubble up to the top through highly-structred crowdsourced logic. Furthermore, this platform will help induvidual people become more logical by allowing them to examine their assumptions or core beliefs, those of others, which will allow them to more explicitly step away from the beliefs that make up their identity and codly examine the logical structure of various arguments and belief systems.

### Foster Home on a Hill

running a foster home with ~20 kids with “average genes” and raising them right, where it’s easy to get 1600 on their SATs, including getting Anders Ericsson and Charles Murray to sign off on the “experimental design” and thinking through a plan and budget (~$1M per year?),  and teaching the kids Socratic teaching so they can make sure not to block the learning of those behind them like I did with tech and my family, and also teaching the kids non-violent communication, Landmark, motivational interviewing, etc, and same with the teachers of course, outlaw commenting on the looks of kids, especially by adults, discourage (but don’t disallow) the consuming of media with negative messages (at least until a kid is old enough to have a critical discussion about it), what about sexuality?, and where to get the kids legally? 

### Starting a Libertarian Country

### Better website CMS platform than github pages

everything is an entity with an ID that I can refer to (without linking to it via http:// which might change), similar to notion.so, and similar to medium’s comments which are full blogs in their own rights that can be commented on, could be used with futureofcoding.org/links so I can add my notes and also get the notes of others, like a combo of reddit and slack in a way, version control, open, unlike medium or notion

### Write a book "Ally" with Sammy

about sexuality, feminism, dating, consent, etc, from a man’s perspective
