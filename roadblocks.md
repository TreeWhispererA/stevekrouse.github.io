# Roadblocks

Oftentimes, when there’s a roadblock in my way, I deeply internalize that roadblock in my mind. Of course, this is a convenient mental trick that makes it easier for me to think about practical solutions to problems. However I think that this tendency often blinds me from seeing some of the biggest opportunities for change and improvement. 

For example, I have accepted that I can not type for very long on my phone without causing terrible pain in my hands and forearms. Accepting this was a major positive step for me, because I am now pain free and can type as long as I want on an ergonomic keyboard at home. However, I didn’t notice until recently how often I want to code, do emails, journal my thoughts, text someone, etc when I’m on the go but cannot because of this roadblock. My productivity as a person could be let's say 20% higher if this one roadblock was somehow fixed. There are a million potential solutions to it (medical stuff for my hands, building a ergonomic mobile keyboard, getting into the habit of always bringing my computer and ergonomic keyboard around, finding good voice dictation software, etc), but I can only think of those solutions if I acknowledge that the roadblock is there. Thus I think it’s important to notice and list such issues.

Another roadblock is my back pain, which makes it hard to sit for a while, which makes traveling almost impossible, and working anywhere not at my standing desk at home (where I can also do Alexander Technique lay downs) very costly and risky. On a less health focused note, an obvious roadblock is how hard it is to both learn to code and also to code when one knows how (and thus futureofocoding.org). Same with LogicHub. 

### Typing while on the go without pain

### Ability to travel without pain

### Pain 

all chronic pain is roadblock on happiness and motivations and outlook. and those things, chemicals in brain, are roadblocks too

### Difficulty in learning to code (and coding)

### Inability to think logically, in a massively collaborative way

### Making sex risk-free, and thus stigma-free (divorcing it from procreation and curing all related diseases)

### The expense and hassle of wifi (how amazing it'd be to have afforadable LTE everywhere)

### Not having cell service in the NYC subway

### Not being able to see the numbers of other businesses to know where opportunities are

### Not having a centralized incoming stream to ensure that you don't lose track of things (it's all scattered notifications that go away when you look at them, not when you proccess them)

### The amount of time I spend eating, and other food-related activities
